## Overview

This project consists of three files provided by the educational team at Udacity for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.

The project is based on an index.html file and a styles.css file provided by Udacity. The purpose of the project is to use JavaScript to build a navigation bar that updates dynamically depending on the amount of content (sections) on the page.

To solve the project, techniques of DOM manipulation were used, using JavaScript, Responsive Web Design techniques, and specific knowledge of JavaScript such as iteration methods on data structures, variable creation, conditional statements, modern JavaScript syntax (ES6), event delegation, as well as knowledge of HTML and CSS.
