## Overview

This project consists of three files provided by the educational team at Udacity for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.

The project is based on an index.html file and a styles.css file provided by Udacity. The purpose of the project is to use JavaScript to build a navigation bar that updates dynamically depending on the amount of content (sections) on the page.

The website has the capability of highlighting the current section located in the viewport when scrolling through the page and 
highligting the correspondent nav link.

To solve the project, techniques of DOM manipulation were used, using JavaScript, Responsive Web Design techniques, and specific knowledge of JavaScript such as iteration methods on data structures, variable creation, conditional statements, modern JavaScript syntax (ES6), event delegation, as well as knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Usage

In order to see the website, clone the repository in your local environment, and open the index.html file in a web browser.  Scroll in vertical direction across the page and you will see the behavior described in the Description section above.
